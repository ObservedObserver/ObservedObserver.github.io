--Tagore <br>
The furthest distance in the world <br>
Is not between life and death <br>
But when I stand in front of you <br>
Yet you don't know that I love you. <br>
The furthest distance in the world <br>
Is not when I stand in front of you <br>
Yet you can't see my love <br>
But when undoubtly knowing the love from both <br>
Yet cannot be together. <br>
The furthest distance in the world <br>
Is not being apart while being in love <br>
But when I plainly cannot resist the yearning <br>
Yet pretending you have never been in my heart. <br>
The furthest distance in the world <br>
Is not struggling against the tides <br>
But using one's indifferent heart <br>
To dig an uncrossable river <br>
For the one who loves you . </p>
